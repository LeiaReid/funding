## How the Barnett formula affects education and child mobility

The controversial formula has been used to allocate UK funding throughout Northern Ireland, Scotland, England and Wales for 40 years. But what is the Barnett formula, why is it controversial and what does it mean for education spending?

## What is the Barnett formula?

Simply put, the Barnett formula is a system of grants that dictates the level of public spending in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Under it, extra funding - or cuts - from Westminster are allocated according to the population size of each nation and which powers are devolved to them.

Education spending, much like most UK departments, is a devolved issue. That means how much funding Wales, Scotland, England and Northern Ireland are allocated, is based on the previous years’ percentage of the change in spending in England, on education.

                                Extra funding in England  X  Population proportion compared to England

                                                          X

                                       The extent to which the relevant English
                                   departmental programme is comparable with the
                                 services carried out by the devolved administration

                                  _________________________________________________
                                 
                                 Extra funding in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland

 
Despite its wordiness, the calculation in principle is simple.

The formula is named after its creator Joel Barnett, who devised it in 1978 while Chief Secretary to the Treasury, as a short-term solution to minor cabinet disputes in the runup to planned political devolution in 1979. 

Despite its failure, the formula was retained to aid additional administrative devolution in the Conservative governments of 1979 to 1997 under prime ministers Margaret Thatcher and John Major. It lived on during Labour governments led by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, and then the coalition government with David Cameron. 

HM’s Treasury has no plans to scrap the “longstanding” formula, citing the Formula is not used to determine the total budgets of the devolved administrations, and it’s reliable transparency, “in that it uses readily available data to calculate the changes in the devolved administrations budgets and this has contributed to its longevity.”

Since the Barnett formula is only a convention, it has "no legal standing or democratic justification" so the Treasury could change it. In 2014, shortly before his death in November, Barnett called it a "terrible mistake".

In 2009, the House of Lords Select Committee on the Barnett Formula concluded that "the Barnett Formula should no longer be used to determine annual increases in the block grant for the United Kingdom's devolved administrations... A new system which allocates resources to the devolved administrations based on an explicit assessment of their relative needs should be introduced."
“It’s actually very straightforward which is part of the reason why it’s lasted for so long. People think of it as oh it’s just something in the treasury they have all of these people working on you know typing complex numbers, no it’s actually very straightforward.” said Dr Ed Poole, expert in territorial policy and lecturer at Cardiff University, “It has come a very long way.”

## So why is the Barnett formula controversial?

There have been frequent calls for a review of the Barnett formula and the wider funding system for devolved administrations. Critics say it pays no attention to differing need, and pays no attention to unfair relative differences in public spending.

Ed Poole, emphasised: “There’s no consideration of need at all in the Barnett formula. It’s a kind of historical anomaly. It can only work because England is such a large part of the UK.” stating, “In any normal system, where there's funding distributed around the various territories wether that’s Canada, Australia, Spain, Germany or the US, there’s some sort of consideration of the relative need or the cost of providing public services in different parts of that nation’s state.” 

“But we know there are some parts of the UK that have to spend more just to keep the same level, Wales being the classic example, it costs more to provide ambulance cover where you have sparse populations.”

Issues highlighted by a 2014 parliamentary commission which considered funding for Wales, resulted in Wales’ Barnett formula being amended, so that its block grant won’t fall below the needs-related floor.

Recent devolution, and proposed devolution, of tax and spending powers to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have left the Barnett formula largely unchanged. But to make funding equal, block grants will be adjusted to accommodate the new powers, as is EU law.

So these additional spending powers will see block grants increase, but additional tax powers will see block grants decrease, because of “The Barnett Squeeze”. The adjustments aim to ensure neither the UK Government or the devolved authorities are made worse off because a power was devolved.

**But I thought Wales was underfunded by £300 million?**

So did Jeremy Holtham. Way back in 2010, just before austerity began, he noticed Wales had been underfunded. £300 million underfunded. 

But it was a population problem, said Ed Poole: “He’d written when you measured Wales’ need; we know Wales is poorer. It’s a sparse population, less health population, less educated population and an older population, all of those things cost money; he estimated a 114-118% in order to be funded equally on a needs based England. 

“Wales needed to be at least 114% of the English 100%. He noted we’re not that we’ve slipped before the needs based level, Wales was underfunded by £300m. 

“What has happened since then is Wales has had massive funding constraints, because of austerity, and the formula in that situation does the reverse. So actually we’ve pulled away again. 

“So it’s not written out for good, we’ve still lost a 1.5bn out of the Welsh budget. So this is only a relative improvement compared with England. So this is basically saying that English effects of Austerity have been perhaps starker - this doesn’t include welfare this is only devolved issues - the Holtham bonus doesn’t really apply. 

“That 300m underfunded - you won’t see politicians using at the moment because it’s kinds of out of date. It was correct, but it was a product of its time. Austerity kicked in and the formula has done what it has.”


**“The Barnett Squeeze”**

“The Barnett Squeeze” refers to the convergence of per capita spending between the four devolved nations. It’s what the formula was intended to do.

Ed Poole said, “It’s designed over time to bring funding in line over time with England, but as a result of that, over time when there’s a decline in funding the opposite happens in the formula, and you get this divergence away.”

“The Barnett Squeeze is the built-in fail safe,” Said Ed Poole, expert in territorial politics as well as Welsh politics and Scottish devolution, “It wasn’t built to protect Wales, that’s far too far, it was created to equalize funding.”


## What does it mean for Wales, especially for education?

Wales bagged it’s first change - after 40 years - to apportion public spending across UK regions as part of a deal on tax devolution announced in 2016. 

This agreement with the Treasury will charge the The National Assembly with responsibility for stamp duty land tax (the tax on buying property) and landfill tax in 2018, the calculation of Wales’ annual grant from central government will include a “new needs-based factor” to reflect the smaller Welsh tax base. 

In Westminster, Alun Cairns, the Welsh secretary, said the deal was a “significant milestone in the Welsh devolution journey”. 

The new deal preserves the Barnett formula  but includes an adjustment for Wales to reflect the differences between the Welsh and English economies. But under EU rules, if any of the UK devolved regions takes on tax powers from central government, their block grant has to be cut to compensate. 

Scotland u-turned on a similar funding deal with the Treasury earlier this year, saying it was not ready to take on such a “population risk”. Scottish officials said the proposals meant slower population growth north of the border would mean additional cuts to Scotland’s block grant. 

Welsh ministers were concerned that taking on responsibility for stamp duty collection could reduce overall public spending because the cuts in the government grant would be larger than the growth in property taxes due to the much slower pace of population growth in Wales. 

But Mark Drakeford, Welsh cabinet secretary for finance and local government, said the agreement was “fair to Wales and the rest of the UK”, in parliament. He said the reforms would protect Wales from “undue risks that could arise following the devolution of tax powers from 2018” and put funding on a “stable and long-term footing”. 

Welsh Shadow Minister for Finance, Nick Ramsay, said: “We should recognise that the Fiscal Framework, which guarantees the ‘Barnett Floor’ and eliminates the ‘Barnett Squeeze,’ goes a long way to providing fairer funding for Wales.
 
“The Fiscal Framework was jointly negotiated between the UK and Welsh Governments and represents a massive improvement on the old formula that we had before - and which, it’s worth pointing out, had been left untouched by the last Labour Government.” 

The Office for Budget Responsibility estimated stamp duty was worth around £152m to Wales in 2015-16, and project it to generate £286m by 2020-21. The much smaller landfill tax is set to decline from £34m to £24m over the same period, because of environmental changes to councils’ waste disposal. 

The 2016 agreement also states that from this April, Wales will have the option to take over setting levels of income tax — a much larger tax item which, according to the OBR, will be worth £2.26bn by 2020-21.

“These savings could be redistributed” Said territorial policy expert at Cardiff university Ed Poole, “but there are so many things the welsh government could allocate this money too. We have an unproportionate population here in Wales, there are more old to young, and we need more money allocated to the health budget, just as much as education.”

Last year, education spending was allocated as shown in this sankey diagram. England has such a giant proportion, because of their higher population. As such, you can see how much was spent per pupil relative to the devolved nation’s population size. 

If you play with the js numbers, using jsfiddle, you can really see how much proportionate devolved funding affects educational spending.
